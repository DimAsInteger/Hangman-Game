# Hangman-Game


This hangman game features Sark vs The Master Control Program, which I decided to use as a part of a Tron-like theme for fun. This game prompts the user for individual letters as input
in order to solve for a word that has been chosen from an array specified in the Javascript file. Specifically, this program initializes dash grid specific to each element of the of 
the word chosen from the array. Additionally, the Javascript uses the DOM approach to process I/O generated by the user.
